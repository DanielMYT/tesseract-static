# Set versions of the software and dependencies here.

# Before upgrading to a newer version of a package, ensure that the build steps
# in 'tesseract-static.sh' don't need modifications (sometimes new packages
# introduce new config defaults, build systems, etc.).

# In the same respect, upstream source URLs sometimes change too, so check this
# in the build script too.

# Tesseract version:
TESSERACT_VER=5.1.0
